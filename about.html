        <h2> Creater</h2>
        <p> Myself Kunal kumar from Ai department UG2025 first year in IIT Kharagpur</p>
        <h2> Project</h2>
        <p> This website is a simple clone of Unsplash created as a simple project to practice web development skills. It aims to replicate the basic look and feel of Unsplash, focusing on layout, navigation, and responsive design.While this is not a full-featured application, it demonstrates essential front-end development skills including media queries</p>
        <p> Built using HTML, CSS this project is purely for learning purposes and does not include all features of the original Unsplash. It showcases fundamental concepts only. The main goal of this project is to build a functional and visually appealing interface as part of my learning journey in web development.</p>
        <p>This project helped me improve my front-end development knowledge and gain practical experience in building a small but functional web interface.</p>
